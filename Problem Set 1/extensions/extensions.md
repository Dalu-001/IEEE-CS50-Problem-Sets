# Extensions

In this program, the user is prompted to input a file name together with its extension, (filename.extension).

The string is then formatted to lower-case letters for case insensitivity.

For whatever file name and extension the user inputs, a corresponding media type is printed out

The input is case insensitive, so it doesn't matter if any of the letters are written in upper case.

If a wrong file name or extension is inputted, the command, "application/octet-stream" will be printed out.
