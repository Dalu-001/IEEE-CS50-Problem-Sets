# Interpreter

This program is a very simple calculator that takes in two numbers and an operational symbol, performs the necessary arithmetic, and prints out the required result.

First, the user is prompted to input an expression. Two of these inputs are floating point numbers, and the other is a string (the symbol of operation)

match-case statement is then used to decide which arithmetic operation to perform.

the reference variable is y, hence the line of code; "match y:". This means the code makes conditional decisions based on what 'y' is.

If 'y' is '+', it adds the two floating point numbers and prints out the answer to one decimal place.

If 'y' is '-', it substracts the two floating point numbers and prints out the answer to one decimal place.

If 'y' is '*', it multiplies the two floating point numbers and prints out the answer to one decimal place.

If 'y' is '/', it adds the two floating point numbers and prints out the answer to one decimal place.
