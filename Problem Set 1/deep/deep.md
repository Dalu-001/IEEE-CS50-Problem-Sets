# Deep

In this code, the user is asked a question and prompted to input an answer

The input is formatted so that all the characters are in lowercase, this is because we want our answer to be case insensitive

The answer should be 42 written in any form. Whether "42", "forty two", or "forty-two"

We could also capitalize any of the letters too since our input is case-insensitive.

If any of the answers above are inputed, "Yes" will be printed on the screen.

But if any answer other than the answers above is inputted, it will result in "No" being printed on the screen.
