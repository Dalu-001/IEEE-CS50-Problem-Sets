# Camel Case
 
 In this code, I prompted the user to enter a text in camel case.
 
 Then from line 5, I checked for any occurrence of upper-case letters in the text.
 
 If any upper-case letter is encountered, it replaces it with an underscore and then the lower case of the letter it is replacing.
 
 It then prints out the new text.
