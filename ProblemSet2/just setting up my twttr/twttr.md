# Just setting up my twttr
 
 In this simple code, I prompted the user for an input.
 
 The code removes any space to the left and to the right of the text (.strip())
 
 It also changes any upper case letter to lower case for case insensitivity(.lower()).
 
 The code then checks for the occurrence of any vowels in the input.
 
 If it encounters any vowels, it removes it.
 
 And then prints out the result without any vowels in it.
