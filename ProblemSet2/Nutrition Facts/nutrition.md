# Nutrition Facts
 
 In this code, I prompted the user to input an item.
 
 Then dictionary of keys (fruits) and lists (calories) is created.
 
 Then the code iterates through this dictionary and checks if the inputted item can be found in the dictionary of fruit created.
 
 If it is found, it accesses the list to that fruit.
 
 The fruit is a key and the accessed list is the calories related to that fruit.
 
 The calories to the fruit is then printed out.
 
 If anything, other than the fruit is inputted, the user is prompted to enter a fruit from the list of fruits given.
