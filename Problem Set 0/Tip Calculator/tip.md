# Tip Calculator

In this program, the main function is defined

"dollars_to_float" function is called, in which an argument, "dollars" is passed into

This argument is an input which is the price of a meal, i.e, a floating point number preceded by a dollar sign

"percent_to_float" function is also called, and an argument, "percent" is also passed into it as well

This argument is an input which is the percentage of the payment you would like to use as tip, i.e, a floating point number succeeded by the percentage sign

tip is calculated, which is the product of dollars and percent

"dollars_to_float" function is now defined, and what it does is remove the dollar sign from the dollar variable and make it just a floating point number, and returns the value to the function, so that the function can perform as expected when it is called upon

"percent_to_float" function is also defined, and what it does is remove the percentage sign from the percent variable, make it a floating point number and divide it by 100, and returns the value to the function, so that the function can perform as expected when it is called upon

After all these, the main function is called, so it carries out the entire code beneath line 1, multiplies dollar (which is now a floating point number) by percent (which is also now a floating point number)

The result is then printed out to two decimal places.
