In this program, the user is prompted to enter a text which is spaced with the traditional white space.

then I used the method, ".replace(" ", "...")" to replace the white space with three dots "...".

Notice the white space is in a quotation mark, and the three dots is also in a quotation mark as well, all inside the braces.

According to the ".replace()" method, it replaces whatever comes before the comma (which is in  quotation) with whatever comes after the comma (also in quotation).

After replacement, the formatted/new value is printed out.
