In this code, I made use of 3 variables, (c,m and E)
c is a constant having a value of 300000000
while m is just a variable, which means the user will be prompted to enter the value of 'm'

After the user enters the value of 'm', the code runs and uses the available values to calculate the value for 'E'
i.e, E = m*(c^2)
After running the code and calculating this, the result is printed out on the screen
