# Making Faces

In this code, the main function is defined, which is called at the end of the code for every other line of code to take effect.

In this main function, the user is prompted to enter a text containing an emoticon or just an emoticon.

A function "convert" is called in the main function.

In this convert function, an argument containing a string, which is a text containing an emoticon or just an emoticon is passed, and this function converts it into an emoji.

It uses the ".replace()" method to replace any ":)" or smiling face emoticon with a smiling face emoji 'üôÇ'. And also to replace any ":(" or sad face emoticon with a sad face emoji 'üôÅ'.

After this, the "convert" function is called in the main function, which does its work of converting an emoticon into an emoji.

Then its converted value will be printed out.
